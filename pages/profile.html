            Hello, I'm Kamil Awad. I am a graduate of Computer Communication Engineering from the Lebanese University. During my studies, I developed a strong foundation in computer science fundamentals. I am now committed to the Full Stack Web Development bootcamp provided by SE Factory. My ultimate goal is to become a professional software engineer, and I believe that this bootcamp will help me to achieve that.
